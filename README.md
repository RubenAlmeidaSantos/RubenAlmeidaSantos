Former Culinary Ninja turned Code Warrior! 💻🍳

Hey, I'm Rúben, a Junior Full-Stack Developer with a passion for coding hotter than my stir-fry!

I traded my spatula for a keyboard because coding and cooking share creativity, precision, and magic!

Let's craft clean interfaces and elegant code together, maybe even swap recipes!
