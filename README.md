Former Culinary Ninja turned Code Warrior! 💻🍳

Hey, I'm Rúben, a Junior Full-Stack Developer with a passion for coding hotter than my stir-fry!

I traded my spatula for a keyboard, blending martial arts discipline with coding creativity. When not debugging, I'm perfecting kicks or recipes – because coding and cooking share creativity, precision, and magic!

Let's craft clean interfaces and elegant code together, maybe even swap recipes!

                                      
                                    - 🛠️ Backend programming: Java, Python, Spring Boot;

                                    - 🛠️ Frontend Programming: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, JQuery

                                    - 👀 I like Game development be it through backend or frontend programming;

                                    - 💞️ Love working on impactful projects.
